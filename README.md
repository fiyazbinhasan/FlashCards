# Special Thanks
[Mr. Andrew Burgess](https://twitter.com/andrew8088). I learned how to work with React and Redux from his [envatotuts course](https://code.tutsplus.com/courses/modern-web-apps-with-react-and-redux) back in 2017. The sample app that he showcased, got stuck with me. That's why I've implemented the same things but with [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor), [Fluxor](https://github.com/mrpmorris/Fluxor) and [MudBlazor](https://mudblazor.com/)
